## üéØ Project Overview
**NeuroSigny-AI** is an innovative tool designed to bridge communication gaps by translating **American Sign Language (ASL) into English in real-time** during video calls.  
It allows individuals with hearing disabilities to communicate seamlessly with other participants, enhancing accessibility and inclusion in virtual meetings.

---

## üí° Motivation
Despite advances in AI, real-time ASL translation in video calls is still limited. AI is a very strong tool that can support people with disabilities in working environments and creating equal opportunities.
The goal of NeuroSigny-AI is to **enable smooth and natural conversations**, making digital communication more inclusive and accessible.

---

## ‚ö° Key Features
- **Real-Time Translation**: Converts ASL gestures into English text instantly.
- **Video Call Integration**: Compatible with popular video conferencing platforms.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Minimal setup, intuitive use.
- **Open Source**: Freely available for research and improvement.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Model Choices
The application allows users and developers to choose a model according to their needs. Each model has been chosen for a particular reason and analyzed for its properties.

**ResNet18**:  
- Chosen for its **proven accuracy** on image classification tasks while remaining relatively lightweight.  
- Its **residual connections** help prevent vanishing gradients, making training more stable.  
- Ideal for users who want a **balance between performance and computational efficiency**.

**MobileNetV3-large**:  
- Selected for its **high efficiency on mobile and edge devices**.  
- Uses **depthwise separable convolutions** and optimized architecture for speed.  
- Perfect for users who need **fast inference with limited hardware resources**.

**Custom CNN Model**:  
- Designed for **experimentation and flexibility**.  
- Allows developers to **tweak the architecture** (number of layers, filters, etc.) to suit custom datasets.  
- Serves as a **lightweight alternative** for quick prototyping or smaller-scale tasks.


### Hyperparameters and Tuning

- **Mixup & CutMix** Encourages models to learn more generalized features rather than overfitting to the training set.
- **Adam Optimizer:** Fast convergence for ResNet18 & Custom CNN
- **Sdg Optimizer:** Stable training for MobileNetV3-large
- **Scheduler:** ReduceLROnPlateau helps refine learning toward convergence.

## üß† Technical Overview
1. **Input**: Camera feed from the user.
2. **Preprocessing**: Hand keypoints extraction using OpenCV and Mediapipe.
3. **ML Model**: Custom-trained and Pre-trained Pytorch models to recognize ASL gestures.
4. **Postprocessing**: Converts gestures to text and overlays in the video call in real-time.
5. **Frontend Integration**: React-based interface

### Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Python, Pytorch, Scikit-learn, OpenCV, Mediapipe, FastAPI
- **Frontend**: TypeScript, React, CSS, HTML
- **Cloud**: AWS S3

##  Limitations
The project currently does not cover all ASL expressions. Instead, it is based on constructing words by combining individual letters in ASL.
